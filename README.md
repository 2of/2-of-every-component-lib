# 2of.io UI Library

Im just taking all of the bits I wrote from my little portfolio [2of.io](https://2of.io) project and flubbing them into a nice UI kit.

## Requires:

react-router-dom
react-icons (fa)

Install the package (eventually)
```bash
npm install 2of-components

```bash
git clone xxxx
cd xxxx
